The Web Rover is a terrestrial Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) which uses
web technologies for communication and control. It consists of three
components:
	1) Software which runs on the rover
	2) Software which runs on the Command-and-Control (C2) server
	3) Web-interface (console) which is hosted on the C2 server but runs
	on the user's computer and is used to monitor and control the rover.
