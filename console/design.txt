Interface should be based off military drone controller laptops.
	1) GPS location and map data. Hypothetically this would be various
	maps overlayed with GPS data from the rover. However, since we don't
	have GPS, we might consider using the Google Geolocation API. It will
	estimate our location based on the Wifi access points we can see. We
	can then display some sort of Google Maps visualization. Maybe this
	could be like a 'minimap' like in video games.

	2) First Person View (FPV) video feed. Sent by the drone and as low-
	latency as possible. Should take up the majority of the screen. Can
	display information like the latency and current frame age.

	3) Controls (both instructions and information about current control
	activity. Forward, reverse, left, right, speed adjustment, control
	memory settings.

	4) Status. Things like low-power warning. Maybe others in the future.
