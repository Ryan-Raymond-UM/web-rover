The Server sits in the middle and is universally reachable with a DNS-able
hostname and a static IP address. Rovers can connect to it and register their
availability. This opens a WebSocket from the rover to the server. When an
Operator is ready to connect, they launch the Console and select a Rover to
control. This opens a WebSocket to the server. Now both the Rover and the
Console can communicate directly with the Server.

The second step is to create the WebRTC connection. We have a DataChannel
for direct communication between the Console and the Rover. We will also
have a "Track" for video and audio from the rover.
